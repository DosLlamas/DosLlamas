<summary><h3>ðŸ’» My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I got into coding in 2022. I'm currently studying part time for my Computer Science degree and I teach web development as an instructor at a non-profit, Code2College. Iâ€™m also a Software Engineer Intern, developing applications and curriculum at Coding for Hermit Crabs with React, Ruby on Rails and SQL. I speak English and Spanish.
  

I actually love to learn languagesâ€“spoken language and coding. Before deciding to become a software engineer, I taught myself Spanish with books, videos, talking with friends and teaching Spanish, traveling to latin countries or just going out of my way to speak with someone in Spanish. 
With coding I took the same approach -- Self initiative and Obsession. I now focus on building apps and making tech-related podcasts that impact us from negative to positive and I continue reading books, watching videos, talking with friends, teaching and traveling to Hackathons and events -- places where people like me live and thrive. 

There's someting to be said about using different tools to communicate the same ideas and get the same things done. The languages constantly change as people change and update. You become aware of the pros and cons each language inherently has and how using them affects your thinking. 
  
Currently I have my eyes on Portuguese and Java as my next languages. Stay tuned.
